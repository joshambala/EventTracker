You will need to run a remote server in order for this app to load properly.

For Mac users, I suggest using Terminal to run a server.

For Windows users, I suggest using Commend Prompt to run a server.

Once you are able to get to the file directory using Terminal and/or Command Prompt, you should type npm start and press the Enter key to start the App.

The app is not currently functioning as intended. I am able to edit and save names of invitees, but I haven't solved the issue of being able to add a new invitee or remove an invitee.

Also, currently there is only one event, and users are unable to create their own event.
