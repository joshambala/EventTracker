You will need to run a remote server in order for this app to load properly.

For Mac users, I suggest using Terminal to run a server.

For Windows users, I suggest using Commend Prompt to run a server.

Once you are able to get to the file directory using Terminal and/or Command Prompt, you should type npm start and press the Enter key to start the App.

The app is not currently functioning as intended. Currently a user can edit and save names of invitees/guests, but they are unable to add a new invitee/guest or remove an invitee/guest.

Also, currently there is only one page for one event, and users are unable to create their own event. Once the functionality is there for adding, removing, and confirming invitees/guests, the next phase will be to add the ability to create multiple events, add/remove/edit the invitees/guests, and send email notifications to invitees/guests.
