You will need to run a remote server in order for this app to load properly.

For Mac users, I suggest using Terminal to run a server.

For Windows users, I suggest using Commend Prompt to run a server.

Once you are able to get to the file directory using Terminal and/or Command Prompt, you should type npm start and press the Enter key to start the App.
